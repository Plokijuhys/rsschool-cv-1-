## About myself:

I have experience in the industry as an electrician. Now I work as an engineer.  
And this is really a very serious and interesting work that I like.  
But the desire to constantly learn does not go away.   
I could have written more about myself, but the deadline is already here.  
See you later😉

  * **Reading elrctrical, pneumatic, hydraulic circuit diagrams**
  * **Development of design documentation**
***
## Code example:

I do not know how to do this, but I think the main purpose of this task is to know
markdown,  
so I'll insert something useless here. For example, a fragment with HTML and a piece of JS.  
Thanks for understanding. 🙏
